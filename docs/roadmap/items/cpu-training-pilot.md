## Why it matters

Component speed does not show whether CPU training can improve a model at useful scale. The workstation must be measured under a bounded, pre-registered pilot with the same evaluator as the GPU path.

## Readiness as of 2 November 2026

`NOT_ADMITTED`; no pilot compute or pre-registration is claimed.

| Prerequisite | Current state |
|---|---|
| Shared-vector forward and exact serving arithmetic | Supported for the recurrence-only/no-pointer FBS mode, including snapped and raw gate/transition combinations; synthetic and public trained-artifact CPU/serving parity controls pass. |
| Tied-table and lawful parameter-group trainer | Tied-token and BVG-K normalization/bias/decay/route groups delivered on finite fixtures. |
| Matched admission and exact checkpoint export control | Panel evaluator and gate delivered on finite fixtures. |
| Trained artifact plus internal query panel | Bound: public dual-c131 seeds 1 and 2 have exact CPU/serving parity; the strict corpus driver creates document-disjoint public development samples. |
| Sealed complete-reply and fresh-phrasing panels | Unavailable without credentials; `m2-fresh256` returns HTTP 401. A public 160-prompt panel supports only qualitative generation output, not correctness scoring. |
| Discrete reads/proposals | #3501 is done with finite parity and restart controls. |
| Quantization-aware updates and trained float shadow | Finite integer/float shadow controls are delivered; a genuine trained FBS float snapshot is not published, so the trained comparison remains `NOT_RUN`. |
| FIT pre-registration and pre-run review | Not authored; the bounded public-corpus pilot is ready to pre-register after its final artifact-export control lands. |

## What is missing

Write a pre-registration with a non-author FIT and pre-run review; run at least two seeds or 200 fresh rows; record context-tokens/s, target visits/s, step time, peak RSS, wall time and resume determinism; grade both complete replies and fresh phrasing against headline-preserving controls.

## Done when

- The pre-registration exists before compute and names pass, fail and stop outcomes.
- The pilot runs on the named Ryzen 9 9950X and records its source, binary, hardware, OS and checksums.
- Training loss is never the only outcome; admission, top-1/top-8, exact export, complete replies and fresh phrasing are reported.
- Every historical training family has a final supported, superseded or rejected disposition linked to evidence.
- The REPORT states explicitly whether CPU training is useful for development, ready for a named qualification path, or rejected for the tested configurations.

## Cancel if

Any dependency still fails parity or deterministic resume. A fast but unverified trainer cannot enter the pilot.

## How to start

First collect the child REPORTs and rerun their parity/resume checks at the pilot head. Write the pre-registration with explicit pass, fail and stop outcomes and the machine identity. Import only the selected bounded corpus slice after the sheet is FIT.

## Rules that apply

- Pre-register before CPU research compute.
- Name the Ryzen 9 9950X and exact source/binary identity.
- Report capability and cost together; no loss-only success.

## Sources

- `docs/research/cpu-training-program.md`
- The six preceding CPU component items and their REPORTs
- The current evaluator and panel selected by the pre-registration
